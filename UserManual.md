## Getting Started
Before using our website, it is recommended that you sign in first, as this allows you to access most of the features on our site. To sign in, click the Sign In button at the top right of the page.

Using your student icon account is mandatory to ensure that only RVians (or MOE students) can use the site. You may choose either the “Sign in with Google” function (recommended) or the manual login option.

## The Catalogue
**Before** submitting a report, please look at the catalogue of items. Our homepage shows the latest items being found or lost, so if you have lost an item, chances are it is already there.
Otherwise, you can check our Catalogue page for a more comprehensive list of items. When clicking on a report, you would be able to see the details of the item. 
If that item is yours, you can click the claim button, and the contact information of the reporter will be revealed, allowing both of you to get in touch easily.

## Submitting a Report
We would like to emphasise again to **check the catalogue** before submitting a report. However, should you have found / lost an item, and no one has reported it on the website, you can click the report button at the bottom of the catalogue.
When reporting an item, there are different fields you can fill out. Doing so will give everyone an easier time locating their lost items. Here are the fields you can fill out.

- Title - brief description of item
- Category
- Date Lost
- Location the item was lost / found
- Colour
- Brand (optional)
- Description - more in depth (optional?)
- Image of item (optional - but better if have)
- Your contact details (email, phone no.) to contact you if your item is found or if you found an item
- Reward (optional - to increase chances of your item being found :) )

After completing the fields, click Submit, and your report will automatically appear on the website.

## Reporting a Stolen Item
There is a possibility that someone may falsely claim your item by replying to a report.

Fortunately, our reporting and claiming system keeps detailed records of both reporters and claimers.

If someone claims your item, click the Report Stolen Item button at the bottom of the report. Our administrators will review the case and determine whether it should be escalated to the General Office.

If the item is deemed stolen, the perpetrator will be required to return it, and appropriate consequences will follow.

That is all for the user manual! If you still need additional help, feel free to call the administrator.

## Getting Started
Before using our website, it is recommended that you sign in first as it allows you to use most of the functionality in our website. To do so, click the sign in button on the top right of the page. 
Using your student icon account is **mandatory** to ensure that none RVians cannot use the site (or at least non-MOE students). 
You can choose the "sign in with Google" function (recommended) or the manual login function.

## The Catalogue
**Before** submitting a report, please look at the catalogue of items. Our homepage shows the latest items being found or lost, so if you have lost an item, chances are it is already there.
Otherwise, you can check our Catalogue page for a more comprehensive list of items. When clicking on a report, you would be able to see the details of the item. 
If that item is yours, you can click the claim button, and the contact information of the reporter will be revealed, allowing both of you to get in touch easily.

## Submitting a Report
We would like to emphasise again to **check the catalogue** before submitting a report. However, should you have found / lost an item, and no one has reported it on the website, you can click the report button at the bottom of the catalogue.
When reporting an item, there are different fields you can fill out. Doing so will give everyone an easier time locating their lost items. Here are the fields you can fill out.

- Title - brief description of item
- Category
- Date Lost
- Location the item was lost / found
- Colour
- Brand (optional)
- Description - more in depth (optional?)
- Image of item (optional - but better if have)
- Your contact details (email, phone no.) to contact you if your item is found or if you found an item
- Reward (optional - to increase chances of your item being found :) )

After filling out all the relevant fields, you can finally click the submit button and our website will automatically put up the report for you. :)

## Reporting a Stolen Item
There is a possibility that someone on the website might sneakily steal your item by replying to a report and claiming that it is theirs. 
Fortunately for you, our reporting and claiming system is well-documented, meaning that the identity of both the reporter and replyer will both be stored on the website.
If you find that someone has claimed a report of your item on the website, you can click the "Report Stolen Item" on the bottom of the completed report, and this issue will be brought up to the General Office. 
When the General Office has verified your report, the thief will be forced to return your item and the neccessary punishment will be dealt.

That is all for the user manual! If you still need additional help, feel free to call the administrator.
